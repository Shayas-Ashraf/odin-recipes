    <h2>Pancake Lasagna</h2>
    <p>Until now if you wanted lasagna, you had to make a lot, but thanks to this easy technique, that's all changed.
        This recipe makes 4 single-serve lasagnas, but you easily scale back and just make one, freezing the extra 3
        pancakes for later use! The pancakes in this recipe are actually more like thick crepes that come out tasting
        like egg noodles. It's almost impossible to tell you didn't use pasta--since these pancakes taste like homemade
        lasagna noodles. Make it as-is or adapt it to your personal taste.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the "Egg Noodle" Pancakes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>½ cup cold water</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups full-fat ricotta cheese, well drained</li>
        <li>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely sliced fresh basil</li>
        <li>½ cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Lasagna:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups prepared marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup grated finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely sliced fresh basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Set out 4 small, shallow, oven-proof baking dishes or
            ramekins.</li>
        <li>Combine eggs, salt, olive oil, water, and flour for pancakes in a large bowl. Whisk thoroughly until very
            smooth, then let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Brush oil into a nonstick skillet and set heat to medium. When the skillet is hot, add about 1/4 cup batter
            and tilt the pan so it evenly coats the bottom. Cook until the batter sets and the top surface goes from
            looking wet to dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook the other side for 1 minute. Transfer to a plate and
            repeat to make remaining 3 pancakes. Cut each pancake into 3 triangles.</li>
        <li>Combine ricotta cheese, salt, pepper, cayenne, basil, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for filling in a bowl;
            mix with a fork until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Prepare lasagnas: Spread 2 tablespoons marinara sauce into the bottom of each baking dish. Lay 1 pancake
            triangle on the sauce, then top with about 2 tablespoons ricotta filling, 1 tablespoon Monterey Jack cheese,
            and 2 teaspoons marinara. Repeat to create another layer, slightly pressing down on the second pancake
            triangle before topping with filling and cheese. Top with the remaining pancake triangle, pressing down
            slightly. Add remaining marinara and Monterey Jack, sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano, and drizzle with
            olive oil.</li>
        <li>Place the baking dishes on a large sheet pan and bake in the center of the preheated oven until lightly
            browned and bubbly, about 15 minutes. Let cool for about 5 minutes, then garnish with basil and serve.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chef's Notes:</h2>
    <p>This recipe makes 4 single-serve lasagnas. If you'd like to just make one, cook all 4 pancakes, but freeze 3 for
        later use. Then use 1/4 of the amounts of the filling and lasagna ingredients to make your single-serve lasagna.
    </p>
    <p>You can use mozzarella instead of Monterey Jack and any pasta sauce you like, like a meaty Bolognese. And you
        can add spinach, mushrooms, or anything else you'd like to the layers.</p>
