    <h2>Chef John's Beef Sliders</h2>
    <p>Sliders are a small version of a hamburger. A little trick helps you to get them all the same size so they cook
        evenly and look very professional. Do a couple of tests to determine your perfect degree of doneness and cook
        all the burgers the same amount of time.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground Beef</li>
        <li>16 paper muffin liners</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Secret sauce ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoon mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sweet pickle relish</li>
        <li>8 slider-size burger buns, cut almost through horizontally</li>
        <li>8 slices roma (plums) tomato</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place ground beef onto a work surface; divide into 8 equal-size pieces using a knife or pastry cutter. Line
            8 muffin cups with paper liners.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle bottoms of paper liners with salt and black pepper. Form each piece of burger into a rough ball and
            place into a muffin cup. Season tops with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place a second paper liner on top of each piece of meat and gently press it down to shape the mini burger
            into a round, flat shape. Pull off the paper tops and remove burgers from the muffin cups; remove bottom
            paper liners from burgers.</li>
        <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook burgers in the hot skillet until they have a
            browned crust and are slightly pink in the middle, about 3 minutes per side. Flip burgers and cook 3 minutes
            on other side. Remove burgers to a plate to rest for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, and pickle relish in a bowl; spoon a dollop onto each bun. Place burgers
            onto buns, season with more black pepper, and top with a tomato slice. Close buns and serve.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
    <p>I prefer grass-fed organic beef.</p>
    <p>Approximate cooking times: 3 minutes per side for rare to medium-rare; 4 minutes per side for medium; 5 minutes
        per side for medium-well to well-done.</p>
    <p>Once the sliders are flattened, you can store refrigerated until needed, up to 8 hours.</p>
